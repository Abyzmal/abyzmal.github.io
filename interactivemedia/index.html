        <h2>The Experience: Nikki Lam - Time absorbs the feeling it produces in a new window  </h2>
        <h3 class="profile">
            1) Spend two minutes with the experience and list all of your actions in granular detail.</h3>
            <p class="profile">
                Upon loading the website, I saw the yellow dots floating around and noticed a spinning/mirroring background crossing into itself. I clicked on all the bubbles and saw a story like text rpg window appear telling a story, the text ranged from large to small following different writing convention tools. Overtime showing a timeline or a story that is vague a thought provoking like a broken system. </p>
        <h3 class="profile">
            2) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
            <p class="profile">
                The first thing I paid attention to was the floating bubbles, I paid attention to this first because it was bright and a very strange occurrence for a website portfolio. </p>
         <h3 class="profile">
            3) What did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
            <p class="profile">
                I spent the most time engaging with the bubbles, I was curious as to how many prompts I could get to appear... I also wondered if the size of the bubbles played any importance and whether everything was random or organised. </p>
        <h3 class="profile">
            4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
            <p class="profile">
                Clicking bubbles, reading and staring at the background everytime it changed. I found it amusing as it reminscent of a game play, felt like a distorted world where time, space and logic kind of went out the door, all that was left is the stories it was trying to tell throughout time. From the tiniest detail to the biggest events, all were presented with the same kind of relevance with no priority over each other. </p>
        <h3 class="profile">
            5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
            <p class="profile">
                My impression do the intended goal is that we’re left to unscramble a story and meaning piece by piece. </p>
        <h3 class="profile">
            6) How does the experience communicate it's primary goal?</h3>
            <p class="profile">
                The experience communicates its goal through enticing the users habits of clicking on moving bubbles through curiosity and familiar experiences, similar to bubble wrap and bubbles. You feel the need to interact with it. </p>
        <h3 class="profile">
            7) What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often you are intended to interact with the experience?</h3>
            <p class="profile">
                I feel the experience has a replay ability to it, it’s very mysterious and ominous, the user can develop their own idea of the interactions meaning and there are no set goals or instructions on how to perceive the experience. The way you interact is also very amusing which is something people can mindlessly do for fun, but still get answers and results even if you aren’t intending to find them out anyways. </p>
        <h3 class="profile">
            8) What metaphor or metaphors does the experience's mental model reference?</h3>
            <p class="profile">
                A mental model represented through a metaphor could be ‘the website is like a bubble popping frenzy’, ‘the system is like whack a mole’ and ‘feels like agar.io with less steps’. </p>
        <h3 class="profile">
            9) What does this reference suggest about how you should feel and/or act when engaging with it?</h3>
            <p class="profile">
                The mental model suggests that you should click on things out of curiosity, in a sense of ‘curiosity killed the cat’, the experience intends for users to remember what is shown on the screen, as it’s titled... times absorbs feelings, it’s showing the feelings lost in time that were now discovering through the blank emoji’s. As someone began from fun and curiosity, now leads into actual curiosity to know what it’s about, why is it displaying this kind of content.  </p>
        <h3 class="profile">
            10) What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to you?</h3>
            <p class="profile">
                The most frustrating element is when I click on a bubble/emoji and nothing happens, unlike bubble wrap or bubbles.. a very obvious or strange interaction occurs. However no interaction kind of leads our expectations nowhere, sort of anti-climatic. </p>
        <h3 class="profile">
            11) What is the most satisfying element of the interaction and what makes it satisfying to you?</h3>
            <p class="profile">
                The most satisfying element on the page is the floating bubbles, it feels like a little eco system of sorts. When you click upon it, it brings interesting and yet random information. It has a very mysterious feel to it, almost beyond us the viewers. But at the very end, the satisfying feel of clicking bubbles is entertaining, especially if it’s through mouse and because I’m a bit of a gamer... it feels a bit like a challenge to click them all. </p>
