            "So I looked at life, and told the world, I finally made my life personal... and from then on, in my very own two hands, it truly became mine in both mind, body and soul."

        <body> This project held some sort of personal value to me when I was making this, life is a very confusing matter for me and I will never get an entire answer as life is always changing. 
            I had actually changed my project quite a lot throughout the time I had to make this assignment, parts of the assignment were really confusing to accomplish on my own end, the chatbox idea initialy was super complicated and then I couldn't achieve it in the time I had. However I decided to opt for a more personal route from my heart and share an interesting take on things, it doesn't exactly fall in line with devil's advocate entirely. 
            The 3rd door is both your heart and head coming together, making decisions as one, as you, a whole person or individual on the same page being certain in themselves.
