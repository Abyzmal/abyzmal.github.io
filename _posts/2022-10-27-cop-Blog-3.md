Overall this assignment was pretty fun, I realised how the tiniest of interactions outside our study/game sessions with camera's on led to some really funny and diverse conversations that I definitely will take on board into the future, also I really appreciate this class running even if its your first year of running this and we ran into issues we didn't expect, it defs gave an interesting experience that is probably niche to most people.

So again, thankyou Thomas!!

Hope this class was as sincere to you as it was to us.
