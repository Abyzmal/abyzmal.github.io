So after some decision making, I decided im going to build upon my old code, I felt the coding tutorials above weren’t going to help me build a foundation that I could take my own way.
The fractal was cool, but I felt it had been coded in a way where it only works because of math, I don’t have as much control over the shapes than I thought. I had messed around with it for a bit but decided it wasn’t up for the take.
The Mandelbrot set was a bit hard to use, wasn’t sure how I was going to make it interactive, since it also follows math, I can’t really do much with randomisation other than maybe colour schemes.
So for today I might look towards. Expanding my old code and making it into fully generative AI art sort of, it’s kinda taking the world by storm and I did mess around with in the past like Midjourney.
