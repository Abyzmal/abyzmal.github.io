Hey, honestly with this new assignment I want to explore something new, but I am very burnt out and busy.

I decided it might be worth checking out Tidal Cycles or ORCA, making music with code seems pretty fun, I always had a bit of a music side and really wanted to give a hand at either singing or producing a beat for a song.

Even looking back on my past assignments, I don't think it would be a bad idea and try to accomplish what I sought out at the start, corridor digital do these like satisfying video challenges where all the crew members making a short looping video of satisfying 3d animations.

Above is what got me on the whole 3D train, once you get the complex basics down, anything is reachable from that point on..It would also be a waste to not play to my strengths for this final assignment, I geniunely liked that I was able to bridge into a territory that I was quite afraid in both code and 3d modeling/coding kinda.
