Hello fellow human coder reading this blog, I am actually struggling on figuring out what to do for Net Art assignment. 

I had gone through a few coding tutorials on finding something interactive as sound wasnt my strong suite and wanted to be confident in having something interactive as I’m more visual than audio.
Above I had gone through some tutorials either building a whole new concept away from 3D or to build upon what I had prior which was my spinning 3D shape, but I hadn’t quite yet finalised what I wanted it to be.
