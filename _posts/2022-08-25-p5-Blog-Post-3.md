This is the finalised version of my code, I added variables and more elements to the screen, shapes will rotate in different directions and I also had some shapes initially starting on a offset so I can make more grandiose structures.

I thoroughly enjoyed the process, however I found it hard to implement other features, location on the screen is different compared to a 2d canvas. When I add new features that are primarily based on 2d codes, it wonâ€™t really work the same on my 3D canvas so I had to scrap multiple extra features.
