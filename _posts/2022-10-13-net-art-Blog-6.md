For my final post, I had accomplished what I had set out to achieve, as for marking criteria I am aiming for a pass, I am not good with coding and implementing some features was just stressful, such as iteration, I’m already working with 3D which requires coordinates to position anything.
However I felt I finally fulfilled my code, as much as we were meant to maybe not use our old code for things
I still felt I could have built it in a direction fit for this assignment
And I’m also struggling quite badly as I’ve now got a special consideration, but I am happy with the end result.
I’ll display the final results here and on my html :)
Enjoy viewers and lecturer

you can click and move it around, you can also zoom in and out, however the zoom isn't the best if your mouse/trackpad is sensitive.
