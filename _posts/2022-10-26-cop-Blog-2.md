I gave my hand at ORCA, and it seemed really really cool just however one thing wasn't working. I couldn't get an output nor an input in, so I was getting any sound, however it could be something I could look into the future if I do end up doing sound/music related stuff.

I took a look at Tidal Cycles, but it looked a bit beyond me, so I didn't install it and just left it. I am also a bit short on time to develop something and get reactions.

I was also a bit confused on the assignment when reading it, so I think I will just insert some live coding and get some reactions.
