# https://p5js.org/examples/3d-materials.html

# The tutorial above taught me how to make 3d shapes within my code, I had to switch to WEBGL in my code to enable 3d shapes within my code. From here I used the base sample code as a reference to build off my shapes, and from there I tinkered around several times with many iterations of my code before settling on my final version.

# Iteration One

# Iteration one focused on the tampering of the settings while formatting the code before I go into the deep end of the code, full tinkering and adding new features that way I completely understood the codes functionality.

# Iteration Two

# Iteration two looks towards the formatting of the shapes, aligning the outer rings with each other before i start turning the shapes rings in different directions.

# Some other tutorials i looked at were:

# https://p5js.org/examples/3d-geometries.html

# https://p5js.org/examples/form-3d-primitives.html

# I used these tutorials to change the shapes material around until I found something that I settled on, i also borrowed the lighting system from the 3d Materials and used that to light up my shape system.
