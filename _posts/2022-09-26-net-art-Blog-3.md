I have run into some issues with my late half of the semester as I’m struggling quite a bit across all my subjects, so my dates might start getting out of order.
But I did get around to changing parts of my old code, as previously it was based on gyro scopes and old game objects I was  reminiscent about.
I finally figured out what I had in mind the whole time, it was the Eye of Agamoto from doctor strange.
And I guess the whole latest instalment of doctor strange with multiverse travel and really strange universes had hit me.
I decided to make something along the lines of Psychedelic with moving shapes but I am not quite sure how to achieve the acid trip effect.
My code had previously used some strange lighting material and also changed colour, but I’ll need to reference something else to get where I want it to be.
