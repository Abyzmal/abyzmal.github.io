Now that I have my entire idea set out, I just need to polish it and ensure it gets to where I need it to be, my biggest issue right now is that it’s not interactive as of yet.
I found this bit code that adds camera movement functionality to my code and enables for zooming in and out, however depending on what device the zoom can be super janky
And there was this interesting feature when there isn’t a background, all the shapes and patterns multiply, so I figured if I have colour changing elements and utilise this interesting feature with camera, you can have some control over how you get stuff on the background.
